 # TovTov app.

 Planning your volunteer or giving adventure is finally as easy and convenient as it should be!

Welcome to TovTov app - a national platform that connects between people who need and those who are willing to give – DIRECTLY and for FREE!

While many of us always wanted to help, volunteer, and give away to our community. Not always it was easy to reach out to ones who seek help.

On the other hand, some of us seek for help, but missing the right channel, we allow them to be seen.

With the assistance of TovTov app one can search through requests for help needed, in his home town and even outside. just choose the request that fits you just right - and directly connect with the person to help!

Whether you like to give away or accept help even from the comfort of your home, or if you’re more spontaneous and are already on the go, the TovTov app will help you:

- Easily browse and connect with givers and ones in need worldwide - for FREE

- Filter your search based on locations, interests or causes you'd like to focus on

- Read up on specific request or give away post details and get a clear view with photos, address, and full description.

- Get all your will to give right on the go, and post how you would like to give back. or simply choose from live requests.

- Apply your request for help from the comfort of your mobile phone.

- We also feature the option to be used as a delivery man between one giver to another seeker. and by doing this doing twice for your community.
